"# one_note_clone_project"

* After Clonning this Project in your Code Editor terminal (VS Code Terminal) navigate to the Project Folder
* Then install all the node modules using -> npm i
* In your terminal run ->  nodemon ./app.js   (To start the server)
* And open  http://localhost:3000/ to see the output (if any of your server is running in port 3000 then stop it and try to run again)
* And then open multiple browser tabs and playing with it

 Things to improve:
 1) Page Responsive
 2) Undo Redo sometimes acts wierdly especially in the other browser tabs 
 3) The Pencil output could be made smooth the flow experience should come   (https://codetheory.in/html5-canvas-drawing-lines-with-smooth-edges/)
